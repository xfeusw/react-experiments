# react-experiments

A collection of small React experiments.

This repository is used to explore React concepts, APIs, and patterns through short, focused prototypes.
Each experiment is self-contained and may use different tooling depending on the goal.

## Purpose

- Learn React by experimentation
- Test ideas without production constraints
- Explore patterns, behavior, and performance
- Keep experiments small and disposable

## Notes

- Code may be incomplete or rough
- Experiments can change or be removed at any time
- Not intended for production use
